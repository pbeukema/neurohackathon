On May 22-23, Carnegie Mellon University hosted the 2nd annual 
[neurohackathon](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2017/may/neurohackathon.html) with the goal of bringing together  neuroscientists and ML/AI researchers to tackle unanswered questions in neurobiology. Within 24 hours, you are given a dataset, complete the analysis, make slides and give a talk. Our group examined a neuorimaging EEG dataset to decide if higher density electrodes contained more information than lower density electrodes. Due to the extremely coarse resolution of EEG this is an interesting question.
